// Marshaler is the interface implemented by types that
// can marshal themselves into valid JSON.
type Marshaler interface {
	MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
}

// Marshal returns the JSON encoding of v.
//
// Marshal traverses the value v recursively.
// If an encountered value implements the Marshaler interface
// and is not a nil pointer, Marshal calls its MarshalJSON method
// to produce JSON. If no MarshalJSON method is present but the
// value implements encoding.TextMarshaler instead, Marshal calls
// its MarshalText method and encodes the result as a JSON string.
// The nil pointer exception is not strictly necessary
// but mimics a similar, necessary exception in the behavior of
// UnmarshalJSON.
//
// Otherwise, Marshal uses the following type-dependent default encodings:
//
// Boolean values encode as JSON booleans.
//
// Floating point, integer, and Number values encode as JSON numbers.
//
// String values encode as JSON strings coerced to valid UTF-8,
// replacing invalid bytes with the Unicode replacement rune.
// The angle brackets "<" and ">" are escaped to "\u003c" and "\u003e"
// to keep some browsers from misinterpreting JSON output as HTML.
// Ampersand "&" is also escaped to "\u0026" for the same reason.
// This escaping can be disabled using an Encoder that had SetEscapeHTML(false)
// called on it.
//
// Array and slice values encode as JSON arrays, except that
// []byte encodes as a base64-encoded string, and a nil slice
// encodes as the null JSON value.
//
// Struct values encode as JSON objects.
// Each exported struct field becomes a member of the object, using the
// field name as the object key, unless the field is omitted for one of the
// reasons given below.
//
// The encoding of each struct field can be customized by the format string
// stored under the "json" key in the struct field's tag.
// The format string gives the name of the field, possibly followed by a
// comma-separated list of options. The name may be empty in order to
// specify options without overriding the default field name.
//
// The "omitempty" option specifies that the field should be omitted
// from the encoding if the field has an empty value, defined as
// false, 0, a nil pointer, a nil interface value, and any empty array,
// slice, map, or string.
//
// As a special case, if the field tag is "-", the field is always omitted.
// Note that a field with name "-" can still be generated using the tag "-,".
//
// Examples of struct field tags and their meanings:
//
//   // Field appears in JSON as key "myName".
//   Field int `json:"myName"`
//
//   // Field appears in JSON as key "myName" and
//   // the field is omitted from the object if its value is empty,
//   // as defined above.
//   Field int `json:"myName,omitempty"`
//
//   // Field appears in JSON as key "Field" (the default), but
//   // the field is skipped if empty.
//   // Note the leading comma.
//   Field int `json:",omitempty"`
//
//   // Field is ignored by this package.
//   Field int `json:"-"`
//
//   // Field appears in JSON as key "-".
//   Field int `json:"-,"`
//
// The "string" option signals that a field is stored as JSON inside a
// JSON-encoded string. It applies only to fields of string, floating point,
// integer, or boolean types. This extra level of encoding is sometimes used
// when communicating with JavaScript programs:
//
//    Int64String int64 `json:",string"`
//
// The key name will be used if it's a non-empty string consisting of
// only Unicode letters, digits, and ASCII punctuation except quotation
// marks, backslash, and comma.
//
// Anonymous struct fields are usually marshaled as if their inner exported fields
// were fields in the outer struct, subject to the usual Go visibility rules amended
// as described in the next paragraph.
// An anonymous struct field with a name given in its JSON tag is treated as
// having that name, rather than being anonymous.
// An anonymous struct field of interface type is treated the same as having
// that type as its name, rather than being anonymous.
//
// The Go visibility rules for struct fields are amended for JSON when
// deciding which field to marshal or unmarshal. If there are
// multiple fields at the same level, and that level is the least
// nested (and would therefore be the nesting level selected by the
// usual Go rules), the following extra rules apply:
//
// 1) Of those fields, if any are JSON-tagged, only tagged fields are considered,
// even if there are multiple untagged fields that would otherwise conflict.
//
// 2) If there is exactly one field (tagged or not according to the first rule), that is selected.
//
// 3) Otherwise there are multiple fields, and all are ignored; no error occurs.
//
// Handling of anonymous struct fields is new in Go 1.1.
// Prior to Go 1.1, anonymous struct fields were ignored. To force ignoring of
// an anonymous struct field in both current and earlier versions, give the field
// a JSON tag of "-".
//
// Map values encode as JSON objects. The map's key type must either be a
// string, an integer type, or implement encoding.TextMarshaler. The map keys
// are sorted and used as JSON object keys by applying the following rules,
// subject to the UTF-8 coercion described for string values above:
//   - string keys are used directly
//   - encoding.TextMarshalers are marshaled
//   - integer keys are converted to strings
//
// Pointer values encode as the value pointed to.
// A nil pointer encodes as the null JSON value.
//
// Interface values encode as the value contained in the interface.
// A nil interface value encodes as the null JSON value.
//
// Channel, complex, and function values cannot be encoded in JSON.
// Attempting to encode such a value causes Marshal to return
// an UnsupportedTypeError.
//
// JSON cannot represent cyclic data structures and Marshal does not
// handle them. Passing cyclic structures to Marshal will result in
// an infinite recursion.
